## Reconnaissance

- [ ] Identify target scope and rules of engagement
- [ ] DNS enumeration
- [ ] Port scanning completed
- [ ] Service version detection
- [ ] OS fingerprinting

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/<TargetIP> <TargetIP>
```

```bash
nmap -p- --min-rate 5000 -oA nmap/<TargetIP>-allports <TargetIP>
```

## Web Enumeration

- [ ] Directory brute-force
- [ ] Virtual host enumeration
- [ ] Technology stack identified
- [ ] Default credentials tested

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://<TargetIP> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -o gobuster.txt
```

```bash
nikto -h http://<TargetIP> -o nikto.txt
```

## Vulnerability Assessment

```bash
searchsploit <ServiceName>
```

## Exploitation

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

## Post-Exploitation

- [ ] User flag captured
- [ ] Local enumeration completed
- [ ] SUID binaries checked
- [ ] Cron jobs inspected
- [ ] Credentials harvested
- [ ] Privilege escalation achieved
- [ ] Root flag captured

```bash
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
